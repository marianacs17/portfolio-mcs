                  <h4>Starbucks interface</h4>
                  <p>
                    Fourth semester, I am learning java, we start a school project. We must do a coffee shop interface. 
                    I decide to create mine based on starbucks coffee.
                    So the project consisted of creating an interface for the client to self-serve. 
                    <br>
                    The client was able to make his own order directly in the interface, he was able to choose the coffee 
                    he wanted, the kind of milk, the size, the extra ingredients, every customization possible (almost every single one).
                    Of course there were options for size of the coffee, method of payment and if the client was a member of 
                    the starbucks rewards he could introduce his card number. 
                    <br>
                    This was a object oriented program on java, it was the first and only semester we took java and I really liked it, the 
                    project itself was difficult but fun to do, I enjoy and I'm better at programming visual stuff not really into logical programming.

            <span>
              The next proyect is an Arduino based alarm clock mounted on a Lego chasis we built up.
            </span>
            <p>
              We created this little car with legos, and using an Arduino mega, a clock, a buzzer, buttons, wires, two little motors and sensors.
              This was a challenge because it was the first time using Arduino so we had to learn from scratch. We had a lot of help, from teachers,
              students. Took us a long time due to the learning process, in the meantime we were learning stuff that we were going to implement
              in the project like the sensors.

            <h2>Local API with Node.js and Heroku</h2>
            <div class="line-dec"></div>
            <span>
              I recently learned what an API is and I implemented one myself. <br>
              Using http methods such as GET and POST, helping me of AXIOS to make requests from third party API's. <br>
              I used Age of Empires II and Spotify's API for this little project
            </span>

          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-6">

                <div class="first-service-icon service-icon"></div>
                <h4>Age of Empires II GETs</h4>
                <p>
                  In this API I worked with GET's. Getting lists like the total civilizations, units, technologies, also we could get 
                  specifically a civilization based on the ID.<br>
                  The response is a JSON with all the elements.
                </p>

                <div class="second-service-icon service-icon"></div>
                <h4>Spotify</h4>
                <p>
                  In this API I used POST's to create playlists, add new songs to the playlist previously created. I was able to skip to 
                  the previous song or next song. This was a big challenge because it was my first API and I learned how to use OAuth token
                  because working with spotify required of it.
